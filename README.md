### ✨ What makes this version different?

</div>

Here are the key improvements and features added in this build:

- 🎵 **Better Lyrics Integration:** Added custom themes, bug fixes.
- 🎨 **Better Lyrics Shader:** Enhanced visual effects with fixes.
- 🛡️ **Built-in Adblock:** Enjoy music without interruptions.
- ⏯️ **Non-Stop:** Bypassed the "Video paused. Continue watching?" prompt.
- 🌶️ **Personal Tweaks:** Added some "extra flavor" and customizations to suit my preferences.

---
### ⚠️ Hardware Recommendation

This version includes heavy visual customization. **It is not recommended for very old or low-end hardware.**
- **Windows/Linux:** For the best experience at 1080p60, use a device with at least a **4-core CPU** and decent graphics (Intel UHD/Iris Xe or dedicated GPU). Dual-core CPUs may max out system resources.
- **Mac:** Runs perfectly on Apple Silicon (>M1).
---

### How to use?

- **🚀 Stable Release (Recommended):** You can download the pre-compiled version directly from the **[Releases](https://github.com/NanKillBro/glassy-music-nankill/releases)** page. 
- **🛠️ Latest Experimental (Build from source):** Please check the [Build](#build) section for detailed instructions.

> 
> **Built for me, not for everyone:** 
This fork is heavily "opinionated" and built strictly to satisfy my personal visual preferences. I have intentionally stripped out several customization features to force a specific, out-of-the-box experience. My goal is for you to experience the exact visual aesthetic I intended without needing to configure a single thing. If you don't like the hardcoded layout or the specific styling, you are highly encouraged to fork the repo and DIY, as this project is open-source!
> 
> **Heavy "Vibe Coding" & AI Assistance:** 
This project relies heavily on "vibe coding". As a result, the underlying codebase might be unoptimized, and some features may have bugs or break randomly. I spent a lot of time tweaking the AI output to make it work, but the code architecture might not be perfect. Pull Requests to fix bugs, optimize the code, or enhance features are incredibly welcome! Please be kind and constructive with your feedback or criticism.

## Dev

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NanKillBro/glassy-music-nankill
cd glassy-music-nankill
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm dev
```

Instead of installing pnpm on your system, you can also use [devcontainers](https://containers.dev/). You can use devcontainers either as a development environment in VS Code, or as a way to easily build the project without installing dependencies on your host system.

Note that this has it's own limitations (for example, GUI doesn't work on, at least some, Linux hosts).

## Build your own plugins

Using plugins, you can:

- manipulate the app - the `BrowserWindow` from electron is passed to the plugin handler
- change the front by manipulating the HTML/CSS

### Creating a plugin

Create a folder in `src/plugins/YOUR-PLUGIN-NAME`:

- `index.ts`: the main file of the plugin
```typescript
import style from './style.css?inline'; // import style as inline

import { createPlugin } from '@/utils';

export default createPlugin({
  name: 'Plugin Label',
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic show restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  stylesheets: [style], // your custom style,
  menu: async ({ getConfig, setConfig }) => {
    // All *Config methods are wrapped Promise<T>
    const config = await getConfig();
    return [
      {
        label: 'menu',
        submenu: [1, 2, 3].map((value) => ({
          label: `value ${value}`,
          type: 'radio',
          checked: config.value === value,
          click() {
            setConfig({ value });
          },
        })),
      },
    ];
  },
  backend: {
    start({ window, ipc }) {
      window.maximize();

      // you can communicate with renderer plugin
      ipc.handle('some-event', () => {
        return 'hello';
      });
    },
    // it fired when config changed
    onConfigChange(newConfig) { /* ... */ },
    // it fired when plugin disabled
    stop(context) { /* ... */ },
  },
  renderer: {
    async start(context) {
      console.log(await context.ipc.invoke('some-event'));
    },
    // Only renderer available hook
    onPlayerApiReady(api, context) {
      // set plugin config easily
      context.setConfig({ myConfig: api.getVolume() });
    },
    onConfigChange(newConfig) { /* ... */ },
    stop(_context) { /* ... */ },
  },
  preload: {
    async start({ getConfig }) {
      const config = await getConfig();
    },
    onConfigChange(newConfig) {},
    stop(_context) {},
  },
});
```

### Common use cases

- injecting custom CSS: create a `style.css` file in the same folder then:

```typescript
// index.ts
import style from './style.css?inline'; // import style as inline

import { createPlugin } from '@/utils';

export default createPlugin({
  name: 'Plugin Label',
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, pear-desktop will show a restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  stylesheets: [style], // your custom style
  renderer() {} // define renderer hook
});
```

- If you want to change the HTML:

```typescript
import { createPlugin } from '@/utils';

export default createPlugin({
  name: 'Plugin Label',
  restartNeeded: true, // if value is true, ytmusic will show the restart dialog
  config: {
    enabled: false,
  }, // your custom config
  renderer() {
    console.log('hello from renderer');
  } // define renderer hook
});
```

- communicating between the front and back: can be done using the ipcMain module from electron. See `index.ts` file and
  example in `sponsorblock` plugin.

## Build

### Automated Build (Windows Only)
I provide an automated build script ([`build.bat`](https://github.com/NanKillBro/glassy-music-nankill/blob/master/build.bat)) for Windows that handles everything from A to Z, including checking/installing prerequisites, cloning the repository, installing packages, and compiling the app.

1. Download the [`build.bat`](https://github.com/NanKillBro/glassy-music-nankill/blob/master/build.bat) file to any folder on your computer.
2. Double-click `build.bat` to run it. If it prompts for Administrator privileges (required to install missing NodeJS/Git/pnpm), please allow it.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select your build architecture.
4. Once completed, your compiled portable app will be located in the `glassy-music-nankill/pack` folder.

### Manual Build (Linux, macOS, or Windows)

#### 🛠️ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)**: Required to clone the repository.
* **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**: Please install the **latest version**. Older versions will likely cause build errors.
* **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation/)**: Follow this official guide to install `pnpm` globally on your machine.

#### 🚀 Build Steps

1. **Clone the repository and navigate into the project folder:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NanKillBro/glassy-music-nankill
cd glassy-music-nankill
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
Run the following command to cleanly install all required packages:
```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

3. **Build the app for your Operating System:**
   Run the command that matches your target OS:
   * `pnpm dist:win` - Windows
   * `pnpm dist:linux` - Linux (amd64)
   * `pnpm dist:linux:deb-arm64` - Linux (arm64 for Debian)
   * `pnpm dist:linux:rpm-arm64` - Linux (arm64 for Fedora)
   * `pnpm dist:mac` - macOS (amd64)
   * `pnpm dist:mac:arm64` - macOS (arm64)

Builds the app for macOS, Linux, and Windows, using [electron-builder](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder).

### Building in devcontainer

1. Clone the repo;
2. Open the folder in VS Code;
3. Reopen in container when prompted;
4. Run `pnpm build` as above (choosing the desired target);
5. Collect the built files from the `dist` folder.

Since devcontainer uses a mount for the workspace, the built files will be available on the host system as well.

## Production Preview

```bash
pnpm start
```

## Tests

```bash
pnpm test
```

Uses [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to test the app.

## FAQ

### Why apps menu isn't showing up?

If `Hide Menu` option is on - you can show the menu with the <kbd>alt</kbd> key (or <kbd>\`</kbd> [backtick] if using
the in-app-menu plugin)
